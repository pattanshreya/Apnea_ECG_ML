# Apnea_ECG_ML
This project detects Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) from ECG signals using signal processing, feature extraction, and machine learning. ECG data from PhysioNet is filtered and analyzed through RR-interval and HRV features. Models like SVM and KNN classify sleep intervals as apnea or non-apnea.
